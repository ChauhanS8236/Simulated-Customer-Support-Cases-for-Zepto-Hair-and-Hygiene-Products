📊 Project Title: Simulated Customer Support Cases for Zepto Hair & Hygiene Products
This project simulates real-world customer support cases for Zepto Hair and Hygiene Products, covering inquiries, complaints, returns, and product feedback. It models ticket categorization, response workflows, SLA tracking, and resolution analysis to improve service efficiency, customer satisfaction, and data-driven support optimization.

📝 Description
This project analyzes simulated customer support cases for Zepto’s Hair Care and Personal Hygiene product categories. The objective is to identify recurring issue themes, customer satisfaction patterns, operational bottlenecks, and root causes behind escalated cases.
The analysis is presented through interactive visual dashboards and an executive-style insights report covering case distribution, CSAT trends, fulfillment errors, packaging issues, and priority breakdowns.

💼 Business Problem

Zepto’s customer support team is handling increasing complaints across hair and hygiene categories.

However, there is limited structured insight into:

What issues occur most frequently

Which operational areas generate the most complaints

How severity impacts customer satisfaction

Where escalations originate

Which cases pose brand or safety risk

Without structured analytics, leadership cannot prioritize corrective actions effectively.


🎯 Goal of Dashboard

The goal of this dashboard is to:

Identify dominant complaint clusters

Analyze customer satisfaction trends

Detect high-risk (critical & escalated) cases

Map operational root causes

Provide actionable insights for operations, product, and support teams
📊 Walkthrough of Key Visuals
1️⃣ KPI Strip

Displays:

Total cases

Resolution rate (76%)

Average CSAT (3.76/5)

Escalations

High-priority case volume

This provides an immediate executive summary.

2️⃣ Issue Theme Distribution

Horizontal bar chart showing that Fulfillment Errors (32%) are the most frequent complaint category, followed by packaging and transit issues.

🔎 Insight: Warehouse operations are the largest source of customer dissatisfaction.

3️⃣ Priority Breakdown

Doughnut chart showing:

52% of cases are High or Critical

8% are Critical

🔎 Insight: Over half the cases require urgent attention.

4️⃣ CSAT Distribution & Severity Impact

68% of customers rated 4–5 stars

Critical cases average 2.0 CSAT

🔎 Insight: Safety and authenticity cases drastically lower customer satisfaction.

5️⃣ Root Cause Analysis

Breakdown of operational origins:

Warehouse / Fulfillment (Top contributor)

Packaging quality

App & billing issues

Supplier quality control

🔎 Insight: Most issues are operational, not product-based.

6️⃣ Issue × CSAT Heatmap

Visualizes satisfaction impact by issue type.

🔎 Insight: Safety-related cases produce the lowest CSAT scores and represent brand risk.

7️⃣ Weekly Case Trend

Timeline of case volume by priority level.

🔎 Insight: Volume surged in late January, indicating operational strain or demand spikes.

📈 Business Impact & Insights
Key Findings

📦 Fulfillment errors are the primary operational failure point.

⚠️ Safety-related issues have the lowest satisfaction scores and highest escalation risk.

📉 Critical cases significantly reduce overall CSAT.

💻 App & billing bugs directly impact trust and user experience.

📊 76% resolution rate is strong but escalation handling needs improvement.

Strategic Recommendations

Improve warehouse quality checks & SKU mapping accuracy

Strengthen packaging inspection protocols

Audit suppliers for authenticity verification

Prioritize safety case response workflows

Improve app billing validation systems

🚀 Project Outcome

This project demonstrates how structured support case analysis can:

Reduce operational blind spots

Improve customer satisfaction

Identify brand risk early

Support data-driven decision making

Transform reactive support into proactive intelligence
